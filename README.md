# adam-plugins

Personal plugin marketplace by Adam Perlis. The repo is public so the same skill packages can be installed in Claude Code and, where supported, OpenAI/Codex plugin surfaces.

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add adamperlis/adam-plugins
claude plugin install frontend-design-director@adam-plugins
claude plugin install video-skills@adam-plugins
claude plugin install ui-motion@adam-plugins
claude plugin install gaia-brand@adam-plugins
```

### Codex / ChatGPT Desktop

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add adamperlis/adam-plugins
```

Then open the Plugins Directory and install the plugin bundles you want from the `Adam Plugins` marketplace.

## Plugin Catalog

| Plugin | Skills | What it does |
|---|---:|---|

| `frontend-design-director` | 1 | Routes marketing/frontend work by site archetype, then applies evidence-backed composition, motion, typography, and quality gates. |
| `ui-motion` | 3 | Kinetic typography heroes, scroll-linked blur manifesto transitions, and a finger-smeared thermal shader field. |
| `design-constraints` | 1 | Designs UI with explicit spatial and typographic constraints instead of letting the model guess. |

| `fullstack-coding` | 1 | Systematic full-stack development guidance for architecture, debugging, code quality, security, testing, and deployment. |
| `video-skills` | 11 | Complete video production bundle for creator videos, product demos, component loops, tutorials, brand films, thumbnails, and social hooks. |
| `social-video` | 1 | Legacy standalone social-video hooks skill, kept for backward compatibility. Prefer `video-skills` for the complete bundle. |
| `seo-aeo-geo` | 1 | SEO/AEO/GEO audits and implementation for websites and Ghost themes, including schema and AI visibility guidance. |

## Invoking Skills

Claude Code and Codex use different explicit skill syntax:

| Host | Example |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `/frontend-design-director redesign this SaaS homepage` |
| Codex | `$frontend-design-director redesign this SaaS homepage` |

Plain language also works in many clients, but explicit invocation is clearest when you know the skill is installed.

## Frontend Design Director

Use this for substantial marketing sites, landing pages, product frontends, launch pages, and design critiques where the page needs a point of view rather than generic polish.

> /frontend-design-director design a marketing homepage for a developer tool. Preserve the product UI, but rethink the narrative and section structure.

> $frontend-design-director critique this landing page for hierarchy, product proof, motion, and mobile composition.

## UI Motion

The `ui-motion` plugin is for front-end work where the motion idea is the product story, not decoration. It packages three reusable UI skills: two extracted from the Zine homepage direction, and one from Clicker's trackpad disc.

[Try the live UI Motion demo](https://adamperlis.github.io/adam-plugins/plugins/ui-motion/examples/contained-ui-motion-demo.html) or [read its install guide](plugins/ui-motion/README.md). For the full frontend pack, install `frontend-design-director` before `ui-motion`; both are also usable independently.

### `kinetic-inflated-hero`

Use this when you want a full-viewport hero built around living typography: inflated letters, soft-body motion, Matter.js-style collisions, Pretext-inspired kinetic type behavior, SVG goo/blur filters, and a signature word effect.

**Claude Code**

> /kinetic-inflated-hero design a full-screen launch hero for an AI visibility product. Make the main visual inflated physical type, not a dashboard screenshot.

**Codex**

> $kinetic-inflated-hero implement a hero where the word "invisible" blurs and disappears letter-by-letter, then resolves back into focus.

### `scroll-blur-manifesto`

Use this for the section immediately after a loud hero: a quiet editorial argument that resolves from blurred ghost text into sharp copy as the user scrolls. It is especially useful for Lenis + GSAP ScrollTrigger builds.

![Scroll blur manifesto reference](plugins/ui-motion/assets/scroll-blur-manifesto-reference.png)

**Claude Code**

> /scroll-blur-manifesto build a warm, editorial manifesto section where each word appears as a blurred ghost before sharpening on scroll.

**Codex**

> $scroll-blur-manifesto use this after the hero. Keep it warm, editorial, and restrained; use sharp and pre-blurred text layers instead of animating blur on every word.

### `thermal-finger-trail`

Use this for a surface people should want to touch: a heat-camera field in one WebGL shader that a finger smears like wet paint, then slowly heals. From Clicker's trackpad disc. [Try it](https://adamperlis.github.io/adam-plugins/plugins/ui-motion/examples/thermal-finger-trail-demo.html).

![Thermal finger trail reference](plugins/ui-motion/assets/thermal-finger-trail-reference.png)

**Claude Code**

> /thermal-finger-trail build a trackpad hero for my app: a thermal disc a visitor can drag across, with a press ripple. Use our brand's colours for the heat ramp.

**Codex**

> $thermal-finger-trail make the hero object a heat-camera field that reacts to touch, full-bleed on mobile, with reduced-motion support.

## Video Skills
